  Ideally, these two modals should be invoked separately. But because original design supports only
  one modal, it's practically unfeasible to rewrite entire modal-invocation logic.

  So, the dirty solution used here is that we place both modals into one and show only one at a time.
  Essentially, both image and video icons invoke the same modal, just toggling between modal's views.
